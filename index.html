      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pick a Spot:</strong> Choose a sunny place with space for roots to grow.</li>
        <li><strong>Dig a Hole:</strong> Make it twice as wide as the tree's root ball.</li>
        <li><strong>Place the Tree:</strong> Gently lower the tree into the hole, keeping it straight.</li>
        <li><strong>Cover & Water:</strong> Fill the hole with soil, pat it down, and water it well!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Bonus: Give your tree a name and take care of it every week!</p>
