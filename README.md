# FINAL-PROJECT
This is the Final Project to fulfill the requirements of Computer Programming course in The Weekend Academy, IYF
It is about Responsive Design Implementation
The goal is to recreate the provided LG breakpoint mockup with my own creative twist! Maintain the original layout structure (card sizes, spacing, and orientation) for large screens, but reinvent everything else—colors, branding, and additional SM/MD breakpoints—using own unique design vision.
